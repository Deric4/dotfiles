# Homebrew

Brew package install `cat brew-pacakges.md | xargs brew install`

### notes

Vim 7.4 <= needs to be installed for some of the plugins to work. This requires that it be installed with homebrew since the default vim is 7.3. Before installing vim, you must brew install python and compile inorder to use powerline/airline.

The solarized theme had to be added to .vim/colors

Vim youcompleteme pacakage had to run the install.py script to enable clang-completion
